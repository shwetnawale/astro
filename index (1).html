        <h3><a href="stars.html">Stars</a></h3>
        <p>Discover how stars are born, live, and die in the cosmic cycle. Stars are massive balls of gas that generate energy through nuclear fusion. Their life cycle depends on their mass. Small stars like our Sun will eventually become white dwarfs, while larger stars can explode in supernovae and leave behind neutron stars or black holes.</p>

      <div class="card" onclick="window.location.href='blackholes.html'">
        <h3><a href="blackholes.html">Black Holes</a></h3>
        <p>Dive into the mysteries of black holes and their immense gravitational power. Black holes are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. They are formed when massive stars collapse at the end of their lives. Black holes can be classified as stellar-mass black holes, intermediate-mass black holes, and supermassive black holes.</p>

      <div class="card" onclick="window.location.href='galaxies.html'">
        <h3><a href="galaxies.html">Galaxies</a></h3>
        <p>Explore galaxies far beyond our own Milky Way. Galaxies are massive collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter that are held together by gravity. There are three main types of galaxies: spiral, elliptical, and irregular.</p>

      <div class="card" onclick="window.location.href='universe.html'">
        <h3><a href="universe.html">The Universe</a></h3>
        <p>Learn about the vast universe and its origins in the Big Bang. The Universe is everything that exists, including all matter, energy, space, and time. The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted explanation for the origin of the Universe. According to this theory, the Universe began as a singularity and has been expanding ever since.</p>
